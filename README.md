# iScheduleYourDay

Currently developing an App for watchOS to help order your tasks daily.

The purpose of this project is to understand the basis of **SwiftUI**, how to work with **CoreData**, and how to use the **WatchKit framework**.

Future implementations:

* Notifications
* Importation of new Tasks via Remainders
* Change this from a watch-only app, to a watchOS app with an iOS app
