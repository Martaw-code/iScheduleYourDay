Currently developing an App for watchOS 8.5 to help order your tasks daily.

The purpose of this project is to understand the basis of **SwiftUI**, how to work with **CoreData**, and how to use the **WatchKit framework**.

## Tutorial

**Note: Once close the app, the data is going to be saved on your watch. Therefore, if you relaunch the app all Folders and Todos are going to still be there, due to the implementation of the app persistence.**

## Future implementations:

* Notifications
* Add Time and Ubication on Tasks
* Importation of new Tasks from Remainders
* Change this from a watch-only app, to a watchOS app with an iOS app
